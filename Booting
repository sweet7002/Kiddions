FAQ: 

"Why does the installer open Command Prompt during the installation?"

Kiddion is placing the essential files into your Grand Theft Auto directory, you can simply close Command Prompt once the installation is complete.

"Why does Windows Defender say this is a virus?"

This mod is looking for key-presses (to navigate the menu) and is reading/writing to the memory of another process and some AV are nervous about that.
This mod has been manually reviewed thoroughly by a forum's file moderator and is considered safe, otherwise it wouldn't have been approved.
